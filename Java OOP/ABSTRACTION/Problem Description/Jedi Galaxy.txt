Jedi Galaxy

Pesho is Jedi and so he starts gathering stars to grow stronger.
His galaxy is represented as a two-dimensional array. Every cell in the matrix is a star that has a value. Ivo starts at
the given col and row. He can move only on the diagonal from the lowest left to the upper right, and adds to his
score all the stars (values) from the cells he passes through. Unfortunately, there is always an Evil power that tries
to prevent his success.
Evil power starts at the given row and col and instantly destroys all stars on the opposite diagonal – From lowest
right to the upper left.
Ivo adds the values only of the stars that are not destroyed by the evil power.
You will receive two integers, separated by space, which represent the two dimensional array - the first being the
rows and the second being the columns. Then, you must fill the two dimensional array with increasing integers
starting from 0, and continuing on every row, like this:
first row: 0, 1, 2… m
second row: n+1, n+2, n+3… n + n.
The input ends when you receive the command &quot;Let the Force be with you&quot;. When that happens, you must print the
value of all stars that Ivo has collected successfully.
