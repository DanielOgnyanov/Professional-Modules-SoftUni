Greedy Times

Finally, you have unlocked the safe and reached the treasure! Inside there are all kinds of gems, cash in different
currencies and gold bullions. Next to you there is a bag which unfortunately has a limited space. You don’t have
much time so you need to take as much wealth as possible! But in order to get a bigger amount of the most valuable
items, you need to keep the following rules:
 The gold amount in your bag should always be more than or equal to the gem amount at any time
 The gem amount should always be more than or equal to the cash amount at any time
If you read an item which breaks one of these rules you should not put it in the bag. You should always be
careful not to exceed the overall bag’s capacity, because it will tear down and you will lose everything! You will
receive the content of the safe on a single line in the format &quot;item quantity&quot; pairs, separated by whitespace. You
need to gather only three types of items:
 Cash - All three letter items
 Gem - All items which end on “Gem” (at least 4 symbols)
 Gold - this type has only one item with the name - “Gold”
Each item which does not fall in one of the above categories is useless and you should skip it. Reading item’s
names should be CASE-INSENSITIVE. You should aggregate item’s quantities which have the same name.
If you’ve kept the rules you should escape successfully with a bag full of wealth. Now it’s time to review what
you have managed to get out of the safe. Print all the types ordered by total amount in descending order. Inside a
type, order the items first alphabetically in descending order and then by their amount in ascending order. Use the
format described below for each type.
