every vehicle has tank capacity and fuel quantity cannot fall (set) below 0 (If fuel quantity become less than 0 print
on the console &quot;Fuel must be a positive number&quot;).
The vehicles cannot be filled with fuel more than their tank capacity. If you try to put more fuel in the tank than
the available space, print on the console &quot;Cannot fit fuel in tank&quot; and do not add any fuel in vehicles tank.
Add new command for the bus. The bus can drive with or without people. If the bus is driving with people, the air-
conditioner is turned on and its fuel consumption per kilometer is increased with 1.4 liters. If there are no people
in the bus when driving the air-conditioner is turned off and does not increase the fuel consumption.
