Food Shortage

Your totalitarian dystopian society suffers a shortage of food, so many rebels appear. Extend the code from your
previous (Problem 2.Multiple Implementation) task with new functionality to solve this task.
Define a class Rebel which has a name, age and group (String), names are unique - there will never be 2
Rebels/Citizens or a Rebel and Citizen with the same name. Define an interface Buyer which defines a methods
buyFood() and a getFood(). Implement the Buyer interface in the Citizen and Rebel class, both Rebels and Citizens
start with 0 food, when a Rebel buys food his food increases by 5, when a Citizen buys food his food increases by
10.
On the first line of the input you will receive an integer N - the number of people, on each of the next N lines you
will receive information in one of the following formats &quot;&lt;name&gt; &lt;age&gt; &lt;id&gt; &lt;birthdate&gt;&quot; for a Citizen or
&quot;&lt;name&gt; &lt;age&gt;&lt;group&gt;&quot; for a Rebel. After the N lines until the command &quot;End&quot; is received, you will receive names
of people who bought food, each on a new line. Note that not all names may be valid, in case of an incorrect name -
nothing should happen.
On the only line of output, you should print the total amount of food purchased.
