Black Box Integer

You are helping a buddy of yours who is still in the OOP Basics course - his name is Peshoslav (not to be mistaken
with real people or trainers). He is rather slow and made a class with all private members. Your tasks are to
instantiate an object from his class (always with start value 0) and then invoke the different methods it has. Your
restriction is to not change anything in the class itself (consider it a black box). You can look at his class but don&#39;t
touch anything! The class itself is called BlackBoxInt. It is a wrapper for the int primitive.
