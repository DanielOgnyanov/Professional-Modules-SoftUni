Phonebook
Write a program that receives some info from the console about people and their phone numbers.
You are free to choose the manner in which the data is entered; each entry should have just one name and one
number (both of them strings). If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, simply update its
number.
After filling this simple phonebook, upon receiving the command &quot;search&quot;, your program should be able to
perform a search of a contact by name and print her details in format &quot;{name} -&gt; {number}&quot;. In case the contact
isn&#39;t found, print Contact {name} does not exist. Examples:
