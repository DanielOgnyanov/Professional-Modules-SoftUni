ListyIterator

Create a class ListyIterator, it should receive the collection of Strings which it will iterate, through its constructor.
You should store the elements in a List. The class should have three main functions:
 Move - should move an internal index position to the next index in the list, the method should return true if
it successfully moved and false if there is no next index.
 HasNext - should return true if there is a next index and false if the index is already at the last element of
the list.
 Print - should print the element at the current internal index, calling Print on a collection without elements
should throw an appropriate exception with the message Invalid Operation!.
